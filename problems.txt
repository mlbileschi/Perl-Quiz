problems i've noticed:

british spellings are highly favoured to create blanks from.
FIXED years can be negative
FIXED years can be after 2011
if a number is repeated more than once in a sentence, once with BC and once with AD, then shit explodes
[16]
FIXED check out ww2 years, the last one generated. it's not a year. how can we filter these?
correct answer doesn't print whether it's AD or BC

in the pythonProgrammingLanguage file, references in the form of [digit] really fuck up the sentence parsing syntax

need to put the words back in in their original capitalization

everything that's labelled as an adverb is also labelled as a verb because i'm an idiot [running it again right now]

with numbers like 100 million, it thinks in some cases that 100 is a year. see ww2.txt.
days of months are interpreeted as years

captialization will be difficult.
